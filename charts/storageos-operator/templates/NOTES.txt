StorageOS Operator deployed.

If you disabled automatic cluster creation, you can deploy a StorageOS cluster
by creating a custom StorageOSCluster resource:

1. Create a secret containing StorageOS cluster credentials. This secret
contains the API username and password that will be used to authenticate to the
StorageOS cluster. Base64 encode the username and password that you want to use
for your StorageOS cluster.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: storageos-api
  namespace: storageos
  labels:
    app: storageos
type: kubernetes.io/storageos
data:
  # echo -n '<secret>' | base64
  username: c3RvcmFnZW9z
  password: c3RvcmFnZW9z

2. Create a StorageOS custom resource that references the secret created
above (storageos-api in the above example). When the resource is created, the
cluster will be deployed.

apiVersion: storageos.com/v1
kind: StorageOSCluster
metadata:
  name: example-storageos
  namespace: storageos
spec:
  secretRefName: storageos-api
  kvBackend:
    address: <etcd-endpoint>

Newly installed StorageOS clusters require a license to function. For
